# PA-RISC common specification file for 32 and 64-bit processors
# Appropriate defines (PARISC32, PARISC64) must be
# specified before including th is file

# Known Issues:
#  The branch target is annotated onto the line following the branch, not the branch itself
#  There may still be issues with condition codes and instructions like INST,=,N r2,r3,r2 that write back into one of the input argument registers.
#    The condition uses the final value in r2, when it should use the value passed in to r2 before the operation.
#  The implementation of space registers is incorrect. There should really be a 64 bit address space with space register in the upper 64 bits.
#     Right now, the space register is either ignored or else just added to the base address.
#  Some of the pcode could be simplified.


# Attention- Sometimes the source and destination registers can be the same registers.
# When you write to a destination reg, it's important that your pcode always keeps a temp copy
# of the original if you later refer to a source reg.


# Register conventions
#
# r0 is always 0
# r1 scratch register, caller saved
# r2 is rp is the return pointer
# r3 to r18 callee saves
# r19 to r22 caller saves
# r23 is arg3
# r24 is arg2
# r25 is arg1
# r26 is arg0
# r27 is the global data pointer dp and must be set to the .data symbol in the elf header
# r28 is ret0 the subroutine return value, high order word if a 64-bit return value
# r29 is ret1 the low order word of a 64-bit return value
# r30 is sp the stack pointer
# r31 is the millicode return pointer
#
# fr0 is farg0 if floating arg is 32-bits, 64-bit args are in farg1 high and low
# fr1 is farg0 if floating arg is 32-bits
# fr2 is farg0 if floating arg is 32-bits, 64-bit args are in farg3 high and low
# fr0 is farg0 if floating arg is 32-bits
# fr4 is fret floating point return (8 bytes)
#
# Note- only two double arguments can be passed in registers.
# If a function return value is larger than 64 bits, then the caller passes the address in r28
#
# Note- function calls and returns are usually through relocation stubs

# Some notes-
#	lse11 is derived from an 11-bit immediate, so we need to take 2 bytes, not 1 byte as in the original coding
# 	R2 must sometimes be negated before the comparison, as per the manual, Table 5-4
#	The arithmetic comparison must be performed on a larger size temp than the original, so that negating 0x80000000 works correctly
#	temp32 is used because the value of lse11 in the pcode does not flow so well to here - maybe a compiler bug?
